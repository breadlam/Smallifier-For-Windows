# Discord Video Smallifier For Windows

This is a hacked-together app that uses FFmpeg to reduce the size of video clips, mostly for posting in Discord and staying under the default 8mb size limit, so external links don't need to be used.

It was built on top of [Xabe.FFmpeg](https://github.com/tomaszzmuda/Xabe.FFmpeg), in Visual Studio 2019 using .NET 4.7.2, and expects Windows Media Player to be installed on the runtime system.
